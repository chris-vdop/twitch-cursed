twitch-cursed
=============
An ncurses based interface for livestreamer.py.
Can manage favourite streams via a config file and also list right-now played games on stream.
The main purpose for this program, is to make my raspberry pi more easy to use with twitch.
As i continue to add on features to the plugins and plugins also, its functional range may extend.
